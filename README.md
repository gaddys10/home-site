# Typically when I create something new, I will place it in here. 

I have some of my own personal projects and artifacts from professional work in here too, including prototypes.

In here there are links to my LinkedIn and my GitHub

There is a portion of the site that will allow users to download my full resume as well. 

It's responsive to mobile and I am working to make it work seamlessly on all platforms.
